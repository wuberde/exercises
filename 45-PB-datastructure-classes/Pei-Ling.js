1. Person Class
* Create a class called `Person` which accepts the name of a person as a string, and his/her age as a number. The `Person` class should have a method called describe which returns a string with the following syntax: "name, age years old". So, for example, if John is 19 years old, then the function describe of his object will return "John, 19 years old".
